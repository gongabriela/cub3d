# 🧊 cub3d

## 🚀 Overview

**cub3d** is a project from 42 School that aims to recreate the graphics engine of an early first-person shooter (FPS) game, such as *Wolfenstein 3D*, using the **Raycasting** technique.

The main goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of graphical programming and **raycasting** to render a 3D environment from a 2D map, utilizing the **MiniLibX** library.

## ✨ Features

* **3D Rendering:** Creation of a 3D environment based on a 2D map (read from a `.cub` file).
* **Raycasting Implementation:** Implementation of the raycasting algorithm to project walls and create the illusion of depth.
* **Player Controls:** Movement (forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right) and camera rotation (look left, look right).
* **Texturing:** Application of textures to each wall (North, South, East, West).
